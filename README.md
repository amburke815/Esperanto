# Esperanto - A Simple Yet Intelligent Translator For A Somewhat Programmatically Defined Language

I started learning the [Esperanto Language](https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/how-many-people-speak-esperanto-and-where-is-it-spoken) in January of 2022, largely as a mental exercise. I also take great enjoyment in the process of learning a language and the new tools it gives me to view the world differently. In the process of learning Esperanto, I started to become overwhelmed with the sheer amount of new words I was learning and originally had the idea of simply putting them all in a homemade dictionary. What better than a Java HashMap for keeping track of a dictionary? What started out as a simple idea soon grew into a vision for a translator that can programmatically restructure Esperanto words to fit its programmatic grammar. My long-term vision for this project is a full-fledged string parser that can validate, translate, and obey the grammatical structure of Esperanto sentences.
